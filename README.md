Some datascience projects i used to learn about it

## Classification:

‚ù§Ô∏è [Risk of heart diseases](https://github.com/Barboss4/Data-science-projects/blob/main/Risk_of_Heart_Disease.ipynb) -  Identifying the optimal classification model for analyzing the risk of heart diseases.

-  [![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-View%20Project-blue)](https://github.com/Barboss4/Risk-of-Heart-Disease/tree/main) - This project continues the analysis of heart disease risk by implementing a graphical interface.

üì∞ [Fake News Detector](https://github.com/Barboss4/Data-science-projects/blob/main/Fake_news_detector.ipynb) - Fake news detection: Feature extraction with NLP, followed by classification using NN and Random Forest for enhanced accuracy.

üì± [CellPhone Pricing](https://github.com/Barboss4/Data-science-projects/blob/main/Pre%C3%A7o_do_celular.ipynb) - Utilizing advanced classification techniques to categorize cellphone descriptions with precision, thereby delineating their corresponding price ranges.

üè¶ [Loan Approval](https://github.com/Barboss4/Data-science-projects/blob/main/Loan_Approval.ipynb) - A loan approval classifier using Random Forest algorithm developed in Google Colab for predicting loan approval based on applicant's features.

## Clustering:

üõçÔ∏è [Mall_customers](https://github.com/Barboss4/Data-science-projects/blob/main/Mall_customers.ipynb) - This project aims to analyze shopping mall customers' behavior, segment consumption profiles, and optimize business strategies based on data insights.

üå∏ [Parfum Indication](https://github.com/Barboss4/Data-science-projects/blob/main/Clusteriza%C3%A7%C3%A3o_perfume.ipynb) - This project aims to analyze a list of random perfume notes and design the optimal fragrance for various types of customers. By leveraging data analysis and customer preference modeling, we strive to create personalized perfume blends that cater to individual tastes and preferences.
 
- [![webscraping](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-View%20Project-green)](https://github.com/Barboss4/Webscraping-Perfumes) - In this project, I utilize web scraping techniques to gather information about various perfumes. The collected data is then used to perform clustering analysis.
