Some datascience projects i used to learn about it

## Classification:

‚ù§Ô∏è [Risk of heart diseases](https://github.com/Barboss4/Data-science-projects/blob/main/Risk_of_Heart_Disease.ipynb) -  Identifying the optimal classification model for analyzing the risk of heart diseases.

-  [![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-View%20Project-blue)](https://github.com/Barboss4/Risk-of-Heart-Disease/tree/main) - This project continues the analysis of heart disease risk by implementing a graphical interface.

üì∞ [Fake News Detector](https://github.com/Barboss4/Data-science-projects/blob/main/Fake_news_detector.ipynb) - Fake news detection: Feature extraction with NLP, followed by classification using NN and Random Forest for enhanced accuracy.

## Clustering:

üõçÔ∏è [Mall_customers](https://github.com/Barboss4/Data-science-projects/blob/main/Mall_customers.ipynb) - This project aims to analyze shopping mall customers' behavior, segment consumption profiles, and optimize business strategies based on data insights.
